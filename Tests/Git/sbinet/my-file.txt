interesting tuto.
I'd recommand using the nice "hub" command to interact with github.
https://hub.github.com/

it's a Go-based command.
you can install it like so on lxplus:
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/dev
$ export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH

$ go get github.com/github/hub
$ which hub
~binet/dev/bin/hub

$ hub --version
git version 2.2.2
hub version 2.2.0-rc1

The tutorial would then look like:

$ hub clone HEP-FCC/FCCSW FCCSW
$ cd FCCSW
$ hub fork
$ hub co -b my-git-test master
$ ### edit ###
$ hub add Tests/Git/USER/my-file.txt
$ hub ci -m "testing git"
$ hub push USER my-git-test
$ hub pull-request
